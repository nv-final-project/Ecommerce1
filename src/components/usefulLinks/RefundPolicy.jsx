This Refund Policy outlines the conditions under which refunds or exchanges may be requested for products purchased through our Website. By making a purchase, you agree to the terms described in this policy.</p>
                        <p className="mb-[12px] leading-6">We offer a 30-day return period for most products, starting from the date of delivery. To be eligible for a refund or exchange, the product must be unused, in its original packaging, and in the same condition as when received. Certain items, such as personalized products, perishable goods, or items marked as final sale, are non-returnable. Please check the product description before purchasing.</p>
                        <p className="leading-6 mb-[12px]">To initiate a return, please contact our customer support team at support@nivzone.com with your order number and reason for the return. We will provide instructions for returning the product. You are responsible for return shipping costs unless the item was received damaged, defective, or incorrect. We recommend using a trackable shipping service, as we are not liable for lost return shipments.</p>
                        <p className="leading-6 mb-[12px]">Once we receive and inspect the returned product, we will notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If approved, your refund will be processed to the original payment method within 7-10 business days. Please note that shipping fees are non-refundable, and a restocking fee may apply for certain products. If you receive a damaged or defective item, please contact us within 48 hours of delivery to arrange a replacement or refund.</p>
